                I live in Minsk, Belarus. Since school age, he began to get interested in programming. Completed courses
                in web design. Graduated in 2021 from the "Private Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship" in the
                specialty
                "economist-manager". He received a bachelor's degree and a specialist's degree.
                He was retrained at BSUIR ( "Belarusian State University of Informatics and

                It was fascinating that I decided to continue working in this direction, and began to study JS on my own
                by
                the book (David Flanagan - JavaScript. Detailed Guide (6th edition) - 2021). But I realized that without

                study this profession and
                I am improving my knowledge base, including English, and trying to develop in this
                direction.
